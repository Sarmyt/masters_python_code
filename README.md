# Instructions

This code is compatible with the test setup described in my Masters Thesis. If access to the lab is not possible, then set the test variable equal to true and run this code after installing all required dependencies. TensorFlow 1.15.x is required.

The main code to run is the "Run.py" file, while the "Lib.py" file contains all supporting classes and functions.
